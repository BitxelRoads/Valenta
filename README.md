# Valenta Application Test - Website Recreation

This project serves as an application test for Valenta. The primary objective was to faithfully recreate the website found at [https://valenta.io/lp-accounting/](https://valenta.io/lp-accounting/).

This project was completed with significant support from Artificial Intelligence, which assisted in gathering information, optimizing development time, and ensuring high-quality output. The use of AI enhanced efficiency without compromising the dedication and effort put into the project.

## Implemented Features & Improvements

- **Multilingual Support:** Implemented a language toggle to switch content between English and Spanish, including dynamic image changes for sections like "What Can a Digital Assistant Actually Do? More Than You Think".
- **SEO & CRO Enhancements:** Improved the page's Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) with relevant meta tags (description, keywords, robots, Open Graph, Twitter cards) and a canonical URL.
- **Interactive Process Section:** Implemented a didactic three-step process section ("From Chaos to Clarity in Just 3 Steps!") that dynamically changes images on click to clearly explain complex information.
- **Console Error-Free:** Ensured the project runs without any errors in the browser console.

## Technologies Used

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for rapid and responsive UI development.
- **HTML5**: The foundational language for structuring the web content.
- **JavaScript**: Used for interactive elements and dynamic content on the website.

## Project Status
